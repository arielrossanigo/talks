# Talks

This repository was created with the intention of store all my talks but after adding some of them some problems appears: changes in different talks should be track independently and it is not nice to force audience to clone all the talks just to dig into a particular one.

For these reasons, I've started creating different repositories for my talks, but I will mantain a list of them in these readme.
